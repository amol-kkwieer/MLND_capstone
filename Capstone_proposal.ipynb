    "\n",
    "**Investment and Trading - A Stock Price Indicator**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Background\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.\n",

    "*An investment is an asset or item that is purchased with the hope that it will generate income or will appreciate in the future. [...] In finance, an investment is a monetary asset purchased with the idea that the asset will provide income in the future or will be sold at a higher price for a profit.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal will target the finance domain, specifically, the subset of stocks and the stockmarket. Going forward, the definition of investing and trading will be accepted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investing** is the act of committing money or capital to an endeavor (a business, project, real estate, etc.) with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trading** is a basic economic concept involving the buying and selling of goods and services, with compensation paid by a buyer to a seller, or the exchange of goods or services between parties. [...] In financial markets, trading refers to the buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The First Stock Market\n",
    "The world’s first stock markets are generally linked back to Antwerp, Belgium as far back as 1531. However, at the time, the markets dealt with only the affairs of government, businesses, and individual debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the cusp of imperialism's high point, everyone had a stake in the profits from the East Indies. Explorers sailed there in droves but ships were lost, fortunes were squandered, and financiers realized they had to do something to mitigate the risk. In 1602, the Dutch East India Company officially became the world’s first publically traded company when it released shares of the company on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Stocks and bonds were issued to investors and each investor was entitled to a fixed percentage of East India Company’s profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, tens of thousands of companies publically treated on the stockmarkets around the world with milllions of investors ranging from casual individuals and professional day traders to high speed volumne traders and large hedge fund firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Profits\n",
    "Knowing the future or being abit to predict which assets will appreciate or depreciate in value would be advantageous to the owner of said investment. Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples, new articles, research papers\n",
    "- roboadvisors \n",
    "- research papers\n",
    "- application of ML in the field\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Personal movitation\n",
    "The world of machine learning can be to many things and on a personal level finance happens to be one of the more interesting areas. Machine learning can not only help to solve complicated financial problems but also can help people grow their personal weathly (directly or indirectly) whom otherwise would not have the opportunity due to current income or society level, whether this be via analysis of their finanical spending and budgeting or having access to \"roboadvisors\" that, debately, can have the same or better investment returns as people who can afford to hire professional hedge fund managers.\n",

    "_(approx. 1 paragraph)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",

    "Essentially, if you exclude more advanced investing and trading techniques, such as options or x, the main premise is to \"buy low, sell high\". That is, buy your investment at a low price and hope to sell the same investment at price higher then what you bought it for.\n",

    "Problem - how to predict if you buy a stock at price x, that it will be x+y given time t\n",

    "Potential solution - supervised learning model trained on historic data to predict, within a margin of error, the future closing price of a stock. This knowledge would put the owner of said information in an advantageous position, allowing him or her to invest in a company's stock increase or decrease in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your core stock predictor, implement:\n",
    "- A training interface that accepts a data range (start_date, end_date) and a list of ticker symbols (e.g. GOOG, AAPL), and builds a model of stock behavior. Your code should read the desired historical prices from the data source of your choice.\n",
    "- A query interface that accepts a list of dates and a list of ticker symbols, and outputs the predicted stock prices for each of those stocks on the given dates. Note that the query dates passed in must be after the training date range, and ticker symbols must be a subset of the ones trained on.\n"

    "For this project, your task is to build a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. Note that the inputs will contain multiple metrics, such as opening price (Open), highest price the stock traded at (High), how many stocks were traded (Volume) and closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends (Adjusted Close); your system only needs to predict the Adjusted Close price.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose what form your project takes (a simple script, a web app/service, Android/iOS app, etc.), and any additions/modifications you want to make to the project (e.g. suggesting what trades to make). Make sure you document your intended features in your report.\n",

Note that the query dates passed in must be after the training date range, and ticker symbols must be a subset of the ones trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re iterated on your stock predictor a few times, and it is giving results you are happy with (say, predicted stock value 7 days out is within +/- 5% of actual value, on average), implement a more user-friendly interface that lets you specify stock(s) you are interested in and provides predictions at some pre-defined intervals.\n",
    "You can extend the system to suggest good stocks to buy or sell, and when. You could also maintain a portfolio of stocks for the user to make these suggestions more concrete. Document these enhancements in your report, with diagrams, screenshots, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic run of the core system would involve one call to the training interface, and one or more calls to the query interface. Implement a train-test cycle to measure the performance of your model. Use it to test prediction accuracy for query dates at different intervals after the training end date, e.g. the day immediately after training end date, 7 days later, 14 days, 28 days, etc.\n"
